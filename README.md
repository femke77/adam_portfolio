# react-portfolio

![welcome](./src/assets/am.gif)

## Description

- I wanted to create a portfolio using React that I will be able to present to potential employers when looking for jobs after the end of bootcamp. Given the time available at the moment, I was successfully able to get a working infrastructure in place, but I have not yet fleshed out the various components or added styling yet. I will be doing that over the next few weeks as time allows. I'm happy with the fact that the current deployment functions as it should.
